# Password Generator

## Description

The project of the week was to add to a given code for a password generator. This code required adding to the javascript portion of the code. Within the JS code I had to add variables for types of characters being input into the password. The characters of the password could be upper case letters, lower case letters, special characters and numbers. The length of the password had to be between 8 and 128 caracters as well. After each window prompt for the password criteria there was a alert provided, notifying the user of their choice and what the password would contain. Once the criteria was answered the information was then given to the password generator function, which then took the true statements of the user and combined them to then generate a password. 

### Technologies Used
*Javascript
* Github
* VS Code
* Google Developer Tools

### What I Learned

During this weeks challenge figuring out how to take the the choices of the user and combine those selected arrays proved to be a bit challenging and time consuming. However, a friend who has experience with coding was able to assist me and show me the concat syntax for combining two arrays which would then output a new array.
